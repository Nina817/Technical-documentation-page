                  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                  is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                  example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                  its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                  and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                  structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                  variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                  example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                    and page navigation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                    the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

            <article>
                <p>
                  JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                  in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                  Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                  Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                  constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                  JavaScript.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                  declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                  number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                  JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                  class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                  inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                  JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                  requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                  loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                  have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                  be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                  you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                  function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code
                  >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                  greetMe("World");
                </code>
          
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

        <section class="main-section" id="5" style="display: none;">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>5. Variables</h2></header>
            <article>
                <p>
                  You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                  names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                  dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                  JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                  "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                  You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                  identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                  _name.

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                  With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                  always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                  warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                  can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                  below.
                </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="7" style="display: none;">
            <header class="section-header"><h2>7. Variable scope</h2></header>
            <article>
              <p>
                When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                function.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                is an if statement.
              </p>
              <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
              <p>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                ECMAScript 2015.
              </p>
        
              <code
                >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                defined</code
              >
